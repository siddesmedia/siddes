Hi. My name is Alec Wilson (@404) and I am the lead and only developer working on Siddes.
I code this site really whenever I have free time because it is fun. I love bringing new
features for users like @j and @a. Those guys are cool.

Actual stuff about me:
I love coding in my free time now it is mostly on this site. I am still in school and don't
actually have a CS degree. I taught myself everything starting with HTML and CSS. Then Jav-
-ascript. After I learned Javascript, I started getting into exploring around GitHub, I found
an open-source project called Nodetube which was mostly written Javascript but I did not know
that it was Node.js. So I asked them what this "type" of Javascript was and the maintainer
told me Node.js. So I sat down for two weeks and taught myself the understandings of server
side code and the basics of Node.js. After that is history. I love code and it is fun.

About six months later, me and my brother (@x) started building Siddes. We did it because we
are both privacy freaks and realized that there was not many privacy based social networks.
Here we are.
