## Features

- Free speech
- No ads

## Why should I use Siddes?

We don't want to censor our users. So, we won't.

We also want to make this accessible to everyone and for that reason, having an account is completely free. And it will stay that way.

No ads. So how do we get funding? Through donations, like crypto.
